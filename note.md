# SQL

to talk with data base

relational/ non relational
SQL-relational -mysql, postgresql,sqlite
nonSQL- mongoDB, DynamoDB, couchDB

# understanding

looks like exel
ex select email from studnets
ex select email from students where age>21
ex select email from stydents where email like "%naver.com"

My SQL

# 2. What is Database(DB)?

### 1.

- Any collection of related information

  - Phone Book
  - Shopping list
  - Todo list
  - Your 5 best friends
  - Facebook's User Base

- Databases can be stored in different ways

  - On paper
  - In your mind
  - On a computer
  - This powerpoint
  - Comments section

### 2.

- Computers + Database = <3

  - Amazon.com

    - Keeps track of Products, Reviews, Purchase Orders, Credit Cards, Users, Media etc
    - Trillions of pieces of information need to be stored and readily available
    - Information is extremely valuable and critical to Amazon's functioning.
    - Security is peoples personal information(Credit cards, SSN, Address, Phone)
    - Information is stored on a computer

  - vs Shopping List
    - Keeps track of consumer products that need to be purchased
    - 10-20 pieces of information need to be stored and readily available
    - information is for convenience sake only and not necessary for shopping
    - Security is not important
    - information is stored on a piece of paper or even just in someones memory

### 3.

- Database Management Systems (DBMS)
  - A special software program that helps users create and maintain a database.
    - Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information
    - Handles Security
    - Backups
    - Importing/ exporting data
    - Concurrency
    - Interacts with software applications

### 4.

Amazon Database Diagram

- Amazon will interact with the DBMS in order to create, read, update and delete info

### 5. CRUD

- DBMS is able to do CRUD

### 6. Two types of Databases

- Relational Databases(SQL) sequel
  - Organize data into one or more tables
    - Each table had columns and rows
    - A unique key identifies each row
- Non-Relational (noSQL / not just SQL) (very general)
  - Organize data is anything but a traditional table
    - Key-value stores
    - Documents(JSON, XML, etc)
    - Graphs
    - Flexible Tables

### 7. SQL

- actual table

- Relational Database Management Systems(RDBMS)

  - Help users create and maintain a relational database
    - mySQL, Oracle, postgresSQL, mariaDB etc

- Structured Query Language(SQL)
  - Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS.
  - Used to perform C.R.U.D operations, as well as other admministrative tasks (user management, security, backup etc)
  - Used to define tables and structures
  - SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification

### 8. noSQL

- Non-Relational Database Management Systems(NRDBMS)
  - Help users create and maintain a non-relational database
    - mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase etc
- Implementation specific
  - Any non relational database falls under this category, so there is no set lannguage standard
  - Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing C.R.U.D and adminstrative operations on the database

### 9. Database Queries

- Queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information
- As the database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want.
- A google search is a query.

### 10. Wrap up

- Database is any collection of related information.
- Computer are great for storing databases
- Database Management Systems (DBMS) make it easy to create, maintain and secure a database.
- DBMS allow you to perform the C.R.U.D operations and other tasks
- Two type of Databases
- Relational databases use SQL and store data in tables with rows and columns
- Non Relational data store data using other data structures

# 3. Table and Keys examples

- primary key - unique attribute
- define table
- surrogate key - not mapping anything in real word data// it is one kind of primary key
- natural key - social securty number as primary key of table -- // key has mapping or purpose in real world
- foreign key - attribute that we can store on database table that link us another table
  its gonna be primary key in different table and use another table
  ( we can define relationship with different tables)
- composite key // key need two attribute //only together they can be unique not one each
- composite key// both can be forein key and both of them make it togetther unique

# 4. SQL basic

## SQL

- SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Management Systems
  - You can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for you.
    - Create, retrieve, update and delete data
    - Create and manage databases
    - Design and create database tables
    - Perform administration tasks(security, user management, import/export ect)
- SQL implementations vary between systems. ( just little tweak?)

  - not all RDBMS follow the SQL standard to a 'T'
  - The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary

- SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of languages in one :
  - Data Query Language (DQL)
    - User to query the database for information.
    - Get information that is already stored there.
  - Data Definition Language (DDL)
    - Used for defining database schemas.
  - Data Control Language (DCL)
    - Used for controlling access to the data in the database.
    - User and Permissions management
  - Data Manipulation Language(DML)
    - Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database.

## Queries

- A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.
  - TONS of data in a DB
  - Often hidden a complex schema
  - Goal is to only get the data you need.
